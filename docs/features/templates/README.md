# Content templates

<info-box info="">
 	This feature is provided through the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/templates">Content Templates</a> plugin that is included in the Full preset available from the official CKEditor 4 <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site. You can also {@link guide/dev/plugins/README add it to your custom build} with <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">online builder</a>.

This Content Templates plugin provides a dialog to offer predefined content templates - with page layout, text formatting and styles.

A couple of sample templates can be found inside of the plugin directory at install time. The user may design and load their own favorite templates, too.
